# FYP-PROJECT-K-MEANS-CLUSTERING-
ARTWORK IMAGE COLOUR DOMINANT  SORTER USING K-MEANS CLUSTERING

# Background Study
The project focuses on the significance of image and colour theme in understanding 
visual perception and the representation of colours in digital images. By investigating colour themes extracted from art collections, this project aims to explore the potential of utilizing these palettes for image analysis and dominant colour sorting. The project seeks to leverage these insights to develop an automated system that can 
accurately identify and sort the dominant colours within digital images. By doing so, 
the system can assist artists and designers in selecting and applying appropriate colour 
palettes in their visual creations.

# Research Objectives
- To identify the criteria for evaluating the usability and distinguishability of 
colour palette generation  
- To develop Machine Learning model that could reduce the influence of human 
subjectivity and error 
- To create the example prototype of the model Artwork Image Colour 
Dominant Sorter using K-Means clustering 

# Research Significance
- Enhancing creative workflow for artist and designers by providing a tool for 
generating colour palettes from artwork images. 
- Minimizing human subjectivity and error for more consistent and reliable 
colour palettes generation. 
- Efficient colour identification using K-Means Clustering by enhancing the 
accuracy and efficiency of colour identification within artwork images.
